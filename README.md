## Asset Mapper

> The AssetMapper component lets you write modern JavaScript and CSS without the complexity of using a bundler. Browsers already support many modern JavaScript features like the import statement and ES6 classes. And the HTTP/2 protocol means that combining your assets to reduce HTTP connections is no longer urgent. This component is a light layer that helps serve your files directly to the browser.

composer require symfony/asset-mapper symfony/asset symfony/twig-pack

## Symfony components

> Twig components give you the power to bind an object to a template, making it easier to render and re-use small template "units" - like an "alert", markup for a modal, or a category sidebar

## CSRF TOKEN security

> When you trigger an action, a POST request is sent that contains a custom Accept header. This header is automatically populated and validated. In other wordsâ€¦ you get CSRF protection without any work thanks to same-origin / CORS policies implemented by browsers.

[install csrf](https://symfony.com/doc/current/security/csrf.html)

```bash
composer require symfony/security-csrf
```

And activate to apply on headers

[docs](https://symfony.com/doc/current/reference/configuration/framework.html#reference-framework-csrf-protection)

```yaml
# config/packages/framework.yaml

    # ...
    csrf_protection: true
```
